# General instructions

This section provides instructions related to the aspects of data documentation that apply to all data types.
The next sections will then provide information specific to each data type.

The Metadata Editor creates **projects**.

A **project** corresponds to a dataset or digital resource that needs to be documented. What a project includes depends on the type of data.
- For microdata, a project is one or a collection of data files, with all related resources.
- For indicators, a project is an indicator (or time series).
- For database, a project corresponds to the "container" of indicators. It includes a list of indicators, but not the indicators themselves.
- For geographic datasets, a project corresponds to one or multiple raster files, or to one or multiple vector data files.
- For research and scripts, a project corresponds to one or multiple scripts and outputs.
- For images, a project corresponds to one image (which may be available in multiple formats and resolutions)
- For videos, a project corresponds to one single video. 

For all data types, documentation consists: 
1. creating a project
2. selecting a template for the documentation of the project,
3. populating the metadata fields,
4. adding external resources,
5. adding administrative metadata (optional)
6. locking and versioning the metadata (optional)
7. exporting or publishing the metadata.
  
This work can be made collaborative, by sharing the project with other data curators. Typically, a project will be created and edited by one or multiple data curators. It may be reviewed, locked and versioned. A system expert may add administrative metadata (this is usually not done by the data curators; it is a specific  role).
