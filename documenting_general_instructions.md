# General instructions

This section provides instructions related to the aspects of data documentation that apply to all data types. The next sections will then provide information specific to each data type.

Every dataset documented in the Metadata Editor is a **project**. A **project** therefore corresponds to a dataset or digital resource that needs to be documented. What a project includes depends on the type of data.
- For microdata, a project is one or a collection of data files, with all related resources.
- For indicators, a project is an indicator (or time series).
- For database, a project corresponds to the "container" of indicators. It includes a list of indicators, but not the indicators themselves.
- For geographic datasets, a project corresponds to one or multiple raster files, or to one or multiple vector data files.
- For research and scripts, a project corresponds to one or multiple scripts and outputs.
- For images, a project corresponds to one image (which may be available in multiple formats and resolutions)
- For videos, a project corresponds to one single video. 

For all data types, the documentation process for a new project consists of: 
1. Creating a project (by clicking on CREATE NEW PROJECT of IMPORT in the *My Projects* page. Refer to the Quick Start examples.
2. Selecting a template for the documentation of the project (optional, as a default template is automatically selected).
3. Populating the metadata fields
4. Adding external resources
5. Adding administrative metadata (optional)
6. Locking and versioning the metadata (optional)
7. Exporting or publishing the metadata

When a project has already been created, its content can be edited by clicking on the project name in the *My projects* page.
  
This work can be made collaborative, by sharing the project with other data curators or publishing the project in one or multiple collection(s); see section **Managing projects** and **Managing collections**. A project will be edited by one or multiple data curators. It may be reviewed, locked and versioned. A system expert may then add administrative metadata (this is usually not done by the data curators; it is a specific  role).

The following describes the features of the project management that appliues to all types of projects.

## Project Home Page

### Header

The header frame in the *Project home page* provides information on the project identifiers (the editable user-defined primary identifier, and the read-only system-generated unique identifier), on the project owner (typically the project creator, or the user to whom the ownership was transferred), and on the dates the project was created and last modified. The Header also provides an option to select an image (JPG or PNG file) to be used as thumbnail. The thumbnail will be used in the Metadata Editor, and in NADA catalogs if the metadata are published in NADA. 

## Template selection

Datasets are documented based o templates. Templates are customized subsets of the metadata elements available from the metadata standard, possibly complemented by user-defined additional elements (refer to the **Templates** section). The template will determine what data curators see in the navigation tree of the Project pages, and the metadata entry pages. A default template is automatically selected when a new project is created (the template to be used as default is selected by the system administrator; see **Designing templates**). 

The data curator can select another template available in the Metadata Editor. The list of available templates is also selected by the system administrator. 

Changing the template used for an existing project will NOT impact the content of the metadata that has already been entered. No information is lost when a less comprehensive template is selected; all metadata already captured is preserved, even if it is not displayed when the new template is used. 

## Navigation tree

The navigation tree shown in the Project pages reflects the content of the selected template. In a template, metadata elements can be tagged as *required* or *recommended*. The navigation frame provides an option to filter elements, to display only required fields or recommended fields. It also provides an option to only display **empty fields**, i.e. metadata elements for which no content has been provided.

A search box is also provided, allowing users to search a metadata element based on keywords found in the element label.
