# Quick start: Research projects and scripts

In this example, we will document a research project ... 

The only file you need to reproduce this Quick-Start example is the image file *.../scripts/image_computer.jpg* (or any another image of your choice).


**Step 1: Create a new project and add a thumbnail**

To begin, open the Metadata Editor link and log in with your username and password. The "My projects" page will be displayed, showing all projects you have previously created and those that have been shared with you by others, if any. If you are using the application for the first time and no project has been shared with you by other users of the Metadata Editor, the project list will be empty.

Click on "CREATE NEW PROJECT" and select "Script" when prompted to indicate the type of resource you will be documenting.

A new project page will open in a new tab.

We will use the *image_computer.jpg* image (or an image of your choice) as a thumbnail. The image will be displayed in the Metadata Editor and in the NADA catalog if the metadata is published in NADA. Click on the edit button in the screenshot image, and select the image file when prompted.

**Step 2: Enter metadata**

On the left navigation tree, select "Metadata information / Information on metadata" to enter optional elements used to capture information on who documented the research project or script, and when. Enter your name, and the date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). Then click on SAVE.

You can now start entering the metadata related to the project itself. In the navigation tree, first select "Title statement" under "", and enter the required **Primary ID** (a unique identifier of your choice, e.g., JD_SCRIPT_001; if you want to publish the project in a NADA catalog, make sure that this same identifier is not used by another user or for another project). Also, enter the title of the project: "......".
