# Rationale and objectives

The volume and diversity of data made available to the research community are growing fast. But too many valuable datasets remain largely under-exploited. Finding, understanding, and using the most relevant data can be a challenging task for researchers and other data users. To be used more extensively, data must be made easier to **find, understand, access, and use**. The production and exploitation of high quality metadata is a core requirement to meet these objectives.

Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource. Metadata is often called data about data or information about information. (National Information Standards Organization, 2004)

Metadata, serving as a detailed description of datasets, is the foundation upon which search engines rely to proficiently identify and locate data of interest. Metadata are not only needed to enable the data discovery systems. They are also required to allow users to assess the relevance, or fitness-for-purpose, of a dataset.

Producing quality metadata is not a trivial exercise. The adoption of metadata standards and schemas fosters the quality of metadata. Standards and schemas, designed for different data types by communities of professionals, help data curators to produce detailed, comprehensive, and structured metadata. Metadata compliant with metadata standards can be generated programmatically or using specialized software applications. The ***Metadata Editor*** presented in this document is an open-source solution provided by the World Bank for the documentation of multiple data types using different metadata standards (or *metadata schemas*). The application is intended to be flexible (by allowing users to develop and customize *metadata templates*), user-friendly, and collaborative (as a web-based application with advanced user permission settings).

The data types covered by the Metadata Editor, and the related standards and schemas, are the following:

- **FOR STRUCTURED DATA**
   - **Microdata**: the unit-level data on a population of individuals, households, dwellings, facilities, establishments, or other. Microdata can be generated from surveys, censuses, administrative recording systems, or sensors. The Metadata Editor uses the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) Codebook metadata standard for documenting microdata.
   - **Statistical tables**: aggregated statistical information provided in the form of cross-tables, e.g., as published in statistics yearbooks or census reports. Statistical tables are often derived from microdata. The IHSN developed a specific metadata schema for the documentation of tables.
   - **Indicators, time series, and databases of indicators**: Indicators are summary measures derived from observed facts (often from microdata). When repeated over time at a regular frequency, the indicators form a time series. Time series are typically stored in databases.  The IHSN developed a specific metadata schema for the documentation of tables. This schema is a compilation of metadata elements found in lead indicators databases.
   - **Geographic datasets and geographic data services**: Geographic (or geospatial) data identify and depict geographic locations, boundaries, and characteristics of the surface of the earth. They can be provided in the form of datasets (raster or vector data) or data services (web applications). The Metadata Editor uses the ISO 19139 (and the related ISO 19110/19115) for documenting geographic datasets and services.
