# Documenting indicators

Two metadata standards are employed to document indicators and their respective databases. The first standard is utilized to individually document each indicator. The second standard is applied to document collections or databases of indicators.

## Metadata standards

### World Bank metadata schema for documenting the indicator

Indicators are summary measures related to key issues or phenomena, derived from observed facts. Indicators form time series when they are provided for a specific geography and with a temporal ordering, i.e. when their values are provided with an ordered annual, quarterly, monthly, daily, or other time reference. 

The World Bank developed its metadata standard for documenting indicators by compiling and structuring metadata elements utilized by various organizations, including the Bank itself, UN agencies, IMF, OECD, and Eurostat. The standard includes elements such as a unique identifier, label, definition, methodology information, details about the data producer and source, geographic and temporal coverage, a list of relevant keywords or topics, and information on known data limitations, among others.

The standard is compatible with the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) standard. SDMX is a data exchange standard designed to facilitate machine-to-machine data exchanges. It provides a framework for structuring metadata through Metadata Structure Definitions (MSDs), but it does not specify the content of MSDs. Consequently, the Bankâ€™s metadata standard complements and can be integrated within the SDMX framework effectively. The Metadata Editor offers a tool to export metadata templates as MSDs and the indicators' metadata as meta-datasets. This enables the metadata produced using the Metadata Editor to be incorporated into SDMX-compliant data management and dissemination systems.

The World Bank metadata standard also includes a section for documenting the data structure (structural metadata), which outlines how the indicator is organized in the data file or database (Figure 14). This data structure aligns with the SDMX data structure definition (DSD). The data structure details the columns of an indicator dataset (assuming the data are provided in long format). It defines the specific role of each column (in a manner compatible with SDMX) and provides the associated metadata.

The technical description of the JSON schema used for the documentation of indicators is available at https://worldbank.github.io/metadata-schemas/#tag/Timeseries.

### World Bank metadata schema for documenting the database (optional)

### Dublin Core for documenting external resources

For documenting external resources, a template based on the Dublin Core standard is used. See sections **General instructions** and **External resources**.


## Create a project

The first step in documenting an indicator is to create a new project. You do that by clicking on CREATE NEW PROJECT in the *My projects* page. Select *Indicator* as data type. This will open a new, untitled *project home page*. 

In that page, select the Template you want to use to document the indicator. A default template is proposed; no action is needed if you want to use the default template. Otherwise, switch to another template by clicking on *Switch template* in the **Templates** frame. Note that you can at any time change the template used for the documentation of a project. The selected template will determine what you see in the navigation tree and in the metadata entry pages, but switching from one template to another will not impact the metadata that has already been entered; no information will be deleted from the metadata.

## Document the indicator

Refer to the general instructions for instructions on components common to all data types.
Refer to the Guide to data Curators.
Print a copy of the template, or use the Help icons.

### Metadata information


### Indicator description

The documentation of an indicator is a straightforward process. The navigation tree provides access to various metadata entry pages where the information about the indicator can be captured.

Some fields may require looking at the datafiles:
- Geographic coverage: copy/paste if possible. Only include countries/geographies for which data are available (do not copy/paste a code list of countries).
- Time coverage: enter the minimum and maximum only, even if there are missing values in between.
  
AI can help:
- Keywords
- Definition
- Relevance
- Specificity of the definition

Database ID: important for link to database-level metadata

Enter formulas (if template allows)

### Data structure definition

The data structure definition (DSD) allows you to describe how the data are organized in the data file. This is the structural metadata for the indicator. The DSD in the Metadata Editor follows the SDMX standard.

In a data file, the indicator is supposed to be stored in long (not wide) format, i.e. in a database type of format where each row corresponds to one observation value. Each row must contain the core information required to define what the observation value represents, complemented by additional (optional) information.  

Typically, a data file for an indicator will look like one of the two options below, which use the population by sex of two countries as an example.

- ***Option 1***. In option 1, the population by sex is provided as three different indicators: Population, total", "Population, male", and "Population, female". The data file may look like this:

   ![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_indicator_data_format_option1.png)

 - ***Option 2***. In option 2, the information is provided as a single indicator ("Population" with a *dimension* "sex" with values M, F or T for Male, Female, and Total).

Organizations make their own decisions on how to organize their indicators. Using dimensions has the advantage of reducing the number of indicators. But it makes data discovery (indexing and search in data catalogs) somewhat more complex. In some cases, the use of dimensions is the only practical option. For example, data on population by age group (with 9 age groups + total), sex (2 options + total), and urban/rural (2 options with total) would require 10 x 3 x 3 = 90 different indicators. Maintaining a single indicator "population" with 3 dimensions would be more efficient (one indicator can have multiple dimensions).

Properly documenting the data structure of an indicator provides users (and machines) with the information they need to query and use the data.

A data structure definition consists of providing the following information about the indicator and the way it is organized in the data file. This information will be provided **for each column of the data file**:
- ***Name:*** The column name
- ***Label:*** The column label
- ***Description:*** A brief description of the column
- ***Data type:*** The type of variable, with the following possible values: String, Integer, Float, Date, and Boolean.
- ***Column type:*** The type of column, with the following options:
  - ***Dimension:*** In our Option 2 example, column "sex" is a dimension.
  - ***Time period:*** The column indicates the time period to which the observation value applies. In our Option 2 example, "year" is a time period.
  - ***Measure:*** 
  - ***Attribute:*** 
  - ***Indicator ID:*** The column is the indicator unique identifier. Only one column can be an Indicator ID. In our Option 2 example, "IndicatorID" is the Indicator ID.
  - ***Indicator name:*** The column is the name (or title) of the indicator. In our Option 2 example, "Name" is the Indicator ID.
  - ***Annotation:*** 
  - ***Geography:*** The geographic area to which the value corresponds. In our example, column "country" is the geography.
  - ***Observation value:*** The observation value (the "data" itself). In our example, column "value" is the observation value.
  - ***Periodicity:*** 
- ***Time period format:*** Time period format is used to indicate the format of the date in the column identified as Time period. In our Option 2 example, Time period format is "YYYY" as we have data by year.
- ***Codelist:***
- ***Codelist reference:***


### Provenance ###

The **Provenance** container is used to document how and when the dataset was acquired. It is used to ensure traceability.


### External resources

External resources are all materials (and links) that relate to the indicator. This may include documents on methodology, scripts, photos and videos, and any other resource available in digital format. These materials and links are added to the documentation of an indicator in the External resources container. Click on **External resources** in the navigation tree, then on CREATE RESOURCE. Enter the relevant information on the resource (at least a title), then provide either a filename (the file will then be uploaded on the server that hosts the Metadata Editor) or a URL to the resource.

External resources that have already been created for another project can also be imported. To do that, they must first be exported as JSON or RDF from the other project. The click on IMPORT in the External resources page, and select the file. 

External resources will be part of the project ZIP package (when the ZIP package is generated - See the main menu). 


## Database-level metadata

Not to be documented for each indicator
Document once, give it an ID, and enter it in each indicator in field *databaseID*. When published in NADA, this will create a one-to-many relationship.
