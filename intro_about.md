# About

The Metadata Editor is a powerful and flexible open-source application designed to streamline the documentation of data of diverse types, including statistical indicators, survey microdata, geographic raster and vector datasets, documents, images, videos, scripts, and more. It enables users to generate rich, structured metadata that complies with international metadata standards and schemas. Additionally, the application is designed for extensibility, allowing users to integrate new standards, schemas, and updated versions as they emerge.

The Metadata Editor can be deployed as a stand-alone desktop application or as a server-based tool, supporting collaborative metadata curation within research institutions, statistical agencies, data repositories, and digital libraries. When operated on a server, it facilitates multi-user collaboration, version control, and centralized metadata management, enhancing the efficiency and consistency of documentation workflows.

Built with a modular architecture, the Metadata Editor is developed using PHP and leverages APIs for seamless integration with other data systems. It incorporates Python libraries such as Pandas and GeoPandas to support the ingestion of datasets in various formats, extract metadata automatically, and generate summary statistics, making metadata creation both efficient and precise.

## Acknowledgments

The Metadata Editor application was developed by Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank, lead developer) with Olivier Dupriez (Deputy Chief Statistician, World Bank, project manager). 

The application was in part inspired by the Nesstar Publisher software application (by the Norwegian Social Science Data Archive). 

The application benefited from feedback from many colleagues who reviewed and tested it, including Tefera Bekele, Cathrine Machingauta, Rochelle O'Hagan, and Matthew Welch. 

A team at Outsourcify Ltd (Thailand) supported the development of the user interface.
