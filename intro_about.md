# About

The Metadata Editor is a versatile application designed for the documentation of various types of data, including indicators, microdata, geographic datasets and services, documents, images, videos, and scripts. It ensures compliance with established metadata standards and schemas, and offers the flexibility to incorporate additional standards and schemas, as well as new versions of existing ones, in the future.

The application can function as a server-based tool or a stand-alone application. When operated on a server, it facilitates collaboration among curation teams, enhancing the documentation process within data archives or libraries.

The Metadata Editor is a PHP application built on APIs. It utilizes Python libraries Pandas and geoPandas for importing data from different formats, extracting metadata from datasets, and generating summary statistics.

## Acknowledgments

The Metadata Editor application was developed by Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank, lead developer) with Olivier Dupriez (Deputy Chief Statistician, World Bank, project manager). 

The application was in part inspired by the Nesstar Publisher software application (by the Norwegian Social Science Data Archive). 

The application benefited from feedback from many colleagues who reviewed and tested it, including Tefera Bekele, Cathrine Machingauta, Rochelle O'Hagan, and Matthew Welch. 

A team at Outsourcify Ltd (Thailand) supported the development of the user interface.
