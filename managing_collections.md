# Managing collections

When a project is created, it is only visible to its owner (creator). Projects can be shared with other registered users of the Metadata Editor, with different levels of permission (View, Edit, or Admin). This allows project owners to invite specific individuals to collaborate on a project. Refer to the section *Managing projects*.

Another option to share projects and establish collaborations is to publish projects in *Collections*. Collections (and sub-collections) are virtual containers. A project can belong to more than one collection. 

Collections provide a convenient solution to organize projects by theme, by team, or by other types of criteria. This may be useful when the Metadata Editor contains a large number of projects. In the *My projects* page, the list of projects can be filtered by collection. The organization of projects by collections also provides an easy way for metadata administrators to generate summary information for specific groups of projects (refer to section *Administrator tools*.

But the primary and most important role of collections is to help manage permissions. In many cases, an organization will want to assign roles on projects not to specific individuals, but to teams. Permissions on projects can be assigned not only at the project level (with the SHARE option - see *Managing projects*) but also at the collection level. For each collection, the list of collaborators is defined. All collaborators who have access to the collection will automatically have access to all projects published in that collection.

To access the collection management page of the Metadata Editor, click on "COLLECTIONS" in the main menu. Note that this command button will only be visible to users who have credentials to manage collections.

## Creating, editing, or deleting a collection

Creating collections requires credentials. The administrator of the system has full authority to create collections. Only the system administrator can create collections at the root level. Other users who are given credentials can create sub-collections of a specific root-level collection. Up to two sub-levels of collections can be created. 

To **create a new collection at root level**, click on "CREATE NEW COLLECTION". Give your collection a short title, and (optional) a description.

To **create a sub-collection**, open the Options menu for the collection and select ADD SUB-COLLECTION.

The **EDIT** button allows you to edit the name of description of an existing collection.

The **DELETE** button allows you to delete a collection. Note that, because collections are only virtual containers of projects, deleting a collection does not impact the projects themselves.


## Setting permissions for a collection

Use the "MANAGE ACCESS" option to add/edit the list of users you want to share the collection with, and their role. All users listed in this list will be able to view, and possibly edit, all entries listed in this collection.

## Adding projects to a collection

A project can be added to a collection by clicking the option "ADD TO COLLECTION" available in the My projects" page, or in the Project home page (box "Collections"). Refer to the section on **Managing projects** and **Documenting data**.

The collections to which an entry belongs will be listed in the *My projects* page. To remove an entry from a collection, click on the "X" next to the collection name.
