# User login and profile

The administrator(s) of the Metadata Editor within an organization define who can have access to the application. Accounts can be created for users individually, or by configuring an organization's authentication system to automatically register all members of the organization as authorized users of the Metadata Editor.

If you have access to the application, you must login to access it. Open the application URL (specific to your organization) and Login (enter your email or user name and password).

- **Profile**: This opens a page displaying your profile, with an option to edit it. It also provides a function to generate an API key. You will only need an API key if you plan to manage metadata programmatically using the Metadata Editor's API and a programming language like R or Python. Refer to the section on the "Metadata Editor API". It is essential that you keep your API key(s) confidential. The API key embeds information on your profile and permissions. If you have reasons to believe that the API key has been compromised, immediately delete it and generate a new one.
