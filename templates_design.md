# Designing templates

Data curators will rarely make use of all elements of a metadata standard when documenting a dataset. Many elements may not be relevant in the context of an organization. Typically, data curators will document datasets using metadata templates, i.e. customized subsets of metadata elements extracted from a metadata standard. 

Templates can be designed and edited using the Template Manager tool in Metadata Editor. Not all users of the Metadata Editor will have the credentials to creating and edit templates; this is a specific role that must be assigned to users. Templates should be created and maintained by an administrator of the data curation team, then made available to all data curators. 

More than one template can be developed for a given metadata standard, although it is recommended to keep their number small to maximize consistency and to minimize the burden of maintaining a collection of templates.

## Designing a template

For each data type (for each metadata standard), the Template Manager provides a non-editable template containing all elements of the standard, with their default parameters. A custom template will typically be created by duplicating it then editing the copy. The Template Manager allows the administrator of the system to select, for each data type, the template to be used by default.
