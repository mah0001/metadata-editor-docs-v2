# Documenting research projects and scripts

## Rationale

Documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data** has the potential to increase the volume and diversity of data analysis. There is also much value in documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data processing and analysis scripts**. Technological solutions such as GitHub, [Jupyter Notebooks or Jupiter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) facilitate the preservation and sharing of code, and enable collaborative work around data analysis. Coding style guides like the [Google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) and the [Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf) by the British Ecological Society, contribute to foster the usability, adaptability, and reproducibility of code. But these tools and guidelines do not fully address the issue of cataloguing and discoverability of the data processing and analysis programs and scripts. We propose --as a complement to collaboration tools and style guides-- a metadata schema to document data analysis projects and scripts. The production of structured metadata will contribute not only to discoverability, but also to the reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics. 

There are multiple reasons to make reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics a component of a data dissemination system. This will:  

-	Improve the **quality of research and analysis**. Public scrutiny enables contestability and independent quality control of the output of research and analysis; these are strong incentives for additional rigor in data analysis. 
-	Allow the **re-purposing or expansion of analysis** by the research community, thereby increasing the relevance, utility and value of both the data and of the analytical work. 
-	Strengthen the **reputation and credibility** of the analysis. 
-	Provide students and peers with rich **training materials**.  
-	In some cases, satisfy a **requirement** imposed by peer reviewed journals or financial sponsors of research activities. For example, the [Data and Policy Code of the American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) (accessed on June 29, 2020), states that *It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented, and access to the data and code is clearly and precisely documented and is non-exclusive to the authors. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.* 
-	Contribute to **assuring the fairness of policy advice and interventions** resulting from data analysis. Data analysis may be used to identify or target the beneficiaries of policies and programs, or may contribute otherwise to the design and implementation of development policies and projects. By doing so, they also contribute to identifying populations to be excluded from these interventions. Errors and biases may be introduced in analysis by accidental or intentional human errors, by the algorithms themselves, or they can result from flaws in the data. The analysis that informs such projects and policies should therefore be made auditable and contestable, i.e. documented and published. 


## The metadata standard

To make data processing and analysis scripts more discoverable and usable, we propose a metadata schema inspired by the schemas available to document datasets. The proposed schema contains two main blocks of metadata elements: the *document description* intended to document the metadata themselves (the term *document* refers to the file that will contain the metadata), and the *project description* used to document the research or analytical work and the related scripts. We also include in the schema the `tags`, `provenance`, and `additional` elements common to all schemas.
