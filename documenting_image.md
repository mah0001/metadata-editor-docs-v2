# Documenting an image

## Metadata standards

## Image metadata 

This chapter describes the documentation of an image using the Metadata Editor. Images in the context of this chapter refers to digital images, i.e. images available as electronic files. These files will typically be available in a format like JPG, PNG, or TIFF. Images can be photos taken by digital cameras, images generated by computer, or scanned images. The metadata standards used in the Metadata Editor are intended to make these images discoverable, accessible, and usable. For that purpose, metadata must be provided on the content of the image (in the form of caption, description, keywords, etc.), on the location and date the image was generated, on the author, and more. Information on use license and copyrights, on possible privacy protection issues (persons, possibly minors, etc.) is needed to provide users with information they need to ensure their use of the published images is legal, ethical, and responsible.

Some devices used to generate images (such as digital cameras) generate and embed metadata in the image file. Digital cameras generate EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata. EXIF will record information on the date and time the image was taken, on the GPS location coordinates (latitude & longitude, possibly altitude) if the camera was equipped with a GPS and geolocation was enabled, information on the device including manufacturer and model, technical information (lens type, focal range, aperture, shutter speed, flash settings), the system-generated unique image identifier, and more. There are several ways to extract or view an image's EXIF Data. For example, the R packages ExifTool and ExifR allow extraction and use of EXIF metadata, and applications like Flickr will display EXIF content. But with the exception of the date, location (if captured), and unique image identifier, the content of the EXIF does not provide information that users interested in identifying images based on their source and/or content will find useful. Metadata describing the content and source of an image will have to be obtained from another source or using other tools.

EXIF metadata may be useful to some users, but (with a few exceptions like the date the photo was taken and the GPS location if generated), they lack information on the content of the image (what is represented in it). This information must added by curators. Part of it will be entered manually, other could be extracted in an automated manner using machine learning models and APIs. This information must be structured and stored in compliance with a metadata standard. The Metadata Editor uses a metadata schema that combines metadata elements from the **Dublin Core (DCMI)**, and the **IPTC**. When documenting an image in the Metadata Editor, users will select either one or the other option.

### IPTC and Dublin Core standards 

The metadata schema used in the Metadata Editor for documenting images contains two mutually-exclusive options: the Dublin Core, as a simple option, and the IPTC as a more complex and advanced option. The schema also contains a few metadata elements that are common to both options. The schema is structured as follows:

- A few elements common to both options are provided to document the metadata (not the image itself), to provide some cataloguing parameters, and to set a unique identifier for the image being documented. 

- Then come the two options for documenting the image itself: the IPTC block of metadata elements, and the Dublin Core block of elements. Users will make use of one of them, not both.

  - The IPTC is the most detailed and complex schema. The version embedded in our schema is 2019.1 According to the [IPTC website](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/), "The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard is the most widely used standard to describe photos, because of its universal acceptance among news agencies, photographers, photo agencies, libraries, museums, and other related industries. It structures and defines metadata properties that allow users to add precise and reliable data about images." The IPTC standard consists of two schemas: IPTC Core and IPTC Extension. They provide a comprehensive set of fields to document an image including information on time and geographic coverage, people and objects shown in the image, information on rights, and more. The schema is complex and in most cases only a small subset of fields will be used to document an image. Controlled vocabularies are recommended for some elements. 

  - The Dublin Core (DCMI) is a simpler and highly flexible standard, composed of 15 core elements which we supplement with a few elements mostly taken from the ImageObject schema from schema.org.  

- Last, a small number of additional metadata elements are provided, which are common to both options described above.

Two metadata templates are provided with the Metadata Editor to document images. One is based on the Dublin Core option, the other one on the IPTC option. These metadata templates can be edited using the Template Manager.

## Documenting an image using the Dublin Core option

The Dublin Core standard contains 15 core elements, which are generic and versatile enough to be used for documenting different types of resources. Other elements can be added to the specification to increase its relevancy for specific uses. We added a few elements inspired by the [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject) schema from schema.org to the 15 elements.

The fifteen elements, with their definition extracted from the [Dublin Core website](https://dublincore.org/), are the following:

| Element name         | Description                                                      | 
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| identifier           | An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. |
| type                 | The nature or genre of the resource.                             |
| title                | A name given to the resource.                                    |
| description          | An account of the resource.                                      |
| subject              | The topic of the resource.                                       |
| creator              | An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.         |
| contributor          | An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.  |
| publisher            | An entity responsible for making the resource available.         |
| date                 | A point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource. |
| coverage             | The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.|
| format               | The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource. |
| language             | A language of the resource.                                      |
| relation             | A related resource.                                              |
| rights               | Information about rights held in and over the resource.          |
| source               | A related resource from which the described resource is derived. |

We do not use the `identifier` element, as we already have a unique identifier in the common element `idno`. 

We added the following elements to the schema, which are not part of the core list of the DCMI: 

- identifiers
- caption
- keywords
- topics
- country
- gps (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- note

These elements are included in the default template for the DCMI option.
