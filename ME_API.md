# Introduction to the Metadata Editor API

Restful API.

Use programming language

Provide R package and Python library for facilitating use. See next chapters.


## Purposes

Automate tasks. Gain in productivity and efficiency in many cases.

The API is for:
- Data curators:
  - Create new projects;
  - Migrate projects 
  - Maintain projects: add, edit, delete content 
  - Manage my projects
- Administrators: Generate reports ; routine maintenance
- Metadata users: Users here are typically administrators of data dissemination systems who will extract metadata from the Metadata Editor to publish them; these are not end-users as the ME is not a public-facing application
  - Extract metadata for publishing (with filters, check timestamnp; etc. Exploit administrative metadata.  


## Warnings and recommendations

API requires a key.

A key is specific to a registered user.

The roles and permissions of the user are embedded in the key; what you can do after login, you can do using the API.

API keys must be kept secret; do not share, not not enter in plain in you scripts! They are like your password.

If your API is compromised, delete it immediately and generate a new one. Notify the administrator to investigate if the key has been used. 

Additional security: enforce IP check (do not authorize the use of API from outside the organization).
