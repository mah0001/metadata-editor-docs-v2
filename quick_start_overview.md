# Overview

The Quick Start examples provide a fast and effective way to familiarize yourself with the Metadata Editor and experiment with creating standard-compliant metadata. Designed as step-by-step walkthroughs, these examples guide you through the core features of the application, allowing you to practice metadata creation with pre-provided sample files.

Each example focuses on a specific data type supported by the Metadata Editor and includes all necessary materials for replication. If you have an installed NADA catalog and administrator credentials, you will also learn how to publish metadata in an online catalog.

These examples are intentionally simplified to provide an overview of the application's core functionalities and do not cover all available features. For a more comprehensive understanding, refer to the Documenting Data chapter.
