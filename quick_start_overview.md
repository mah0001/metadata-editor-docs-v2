# Quick start: Overview

The Quick Start examples provide a fast and effective way to familiarize yourself with the Metadata Editor and experiment with creating standard-compliant metadata. Designed as step-by-step walkthroughs, these examples guide you through the core features of the application, allowing you to practice metadata creation with pre-provided sample files. Each example focuses on a specific data type supported by the Metadata Editor and includes all necessary materials for replication. 

If you have an installed NADA catalog and have administrator credentials, you will also learn how to publish metadata in an online catalog. NADA is an open source cataloguing application developed by the World Bank. Metadata generated by the Metadata Editor can be directly published in NADA. Refer to the NADA User Guide for instruction on how to install NADA and obtain a NADA API key that would allow you to publish metadata in it.

These examples are intentionally simplified to provide an overview of the application's core functionalities and do not cover all available features. For a more comprehensive understanding, refer to the Documenting Data chapter.

**Available Quick Start Examples**

We provide a dedicated quick start example for each supported data type:

- ***Document*** – Metadata for a working paper.
- ***Microdata*** – A synthetic survey dataset, including variable-level documentation.
- ***Indicator and Database*** – Metadata for a statistical indicator and its source database.
- ***Geographic Dataset*** – Metadata for both vector (shapefile) and raster datasets.

- ***Image*** – Metadata for a digital photograph.
- ***Video*** – Metadata for a video file.

**Getting Started**

Before starting, ensure that:

- You have the Metadata Editor installed on your system (server or PC), with data curator or administrator role that will allow you to create new projects.
- You have downloaded the required example files from [Insert Download Link] and saved them in a dedicated folder.
Once ready, follow the step-by-step instructions provided in each example to practice creating, editing, and managing metadata in the Metadata Editor.
- You have a NADA catalog with the necessary credentials  (only needed if you want to experiment publishing metadata in a NADA catalog).
