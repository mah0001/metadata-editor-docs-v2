# Rationale and Objectives

The volume and diversity of data available to the research community are growing rapidly. However, many valuable datasets remain underutilized due to challenges in discovering, understanding, and effectively using them. To maximize their impact, data must be **easy to find, interpret, access, and apply**. High-quality metadata is essential to achieving these objectives.

Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise facilitates the retrieval, use, and management of data resources (National Information Standards Organization, 2004). Metadata serves as the backbone of data discovery, enabling search engines and cataloging systems to efficiently identify and retrieve datasets. Beyond discovery, metadata allows users to evaluate the relevance, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of a dataset before investing time and resources in its use.

Producing high-quality metadata, however, is a complex task. The adoption of metadata standards and schemas is critical to ensuring metadata consistency, interoperability, and comprehensiveness. These standards—developed by professional communities for different types of data—help data curators create structured and detailed metadata that enhances data usability. Metadata compliant with these standards can be generated either programmatically or through specialized software applications.

The ***Metadata Editor***, presented in this document, is an open-source solution developed by the World Bank to facilitate the documentation of diverse data types using internationally recognized metadata standards (or metadata schemas). The application is designed to be:

- **Flexible** – allowing users to develop and customize metadata templates tailored to their needs.
- **User-friendly** – providing an intuitive interface for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Collaborative** – supporting multi-user workflows with advanced permission settings in its web-based version.
